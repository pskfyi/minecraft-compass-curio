# Minecraft Compass Curio

[Curios](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/curios) support for the
vanilla Minecraft compass. Meant for
[HUD Compass](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/hud-compass) but it
doesn't yet detect items in curios slots.

The `data` directory is a complete
[data pack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Data_pack) to register a custom
Compass slot, add it to the player, and tag the vanilla compass so it can be
placed in the slot.

The `resources` directory is a complete
[resource pack](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Resource_pack) which provides
the English name for the new Compass slot and provides an image for the slot
when it's empty. The image is a stripped-down, two-tone image of the actual
vanilla compass.

These packs were successfully tested with
[Open Loader](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/open-loader).
